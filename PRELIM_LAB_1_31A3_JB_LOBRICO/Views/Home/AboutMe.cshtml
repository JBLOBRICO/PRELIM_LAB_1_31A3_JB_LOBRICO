<h3 class="mb-3">📌 My Expectations for Web Systems and Technologies</h3>
<ul class="list-group">
    <li class="list-group-item">• I want to learn how websites work from the inside — not just how they look.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">• I hope to understand how data moves between users and servers.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">• I want to learn how different technologies connect (HTML, backend, database).</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">• I expect to build something that shows real interaction — not just static pages.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">• I want to gain skills that are actually used in modern websites and apps.</li>
